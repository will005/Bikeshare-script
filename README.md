# Bikeshare-script

This was an introduction to using general puropse python and creating a script that asked for user input and returned bikeshare data. The returned data consisted of 3 separate datasets containing bikeshare logs from 3 different cities over the course of 6 months. This included the starting and stopping point for the trip taken. I initially wrote these in a jupyter notebook, then re-wrote it into a python script. 

This project was a part of Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree.
